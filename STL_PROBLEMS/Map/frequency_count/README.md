## Input Format:
### First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase there will be three lines. First line of 
### which contains N, size of vector. Second line contains N positive integers separated by space, and third 
### line contains X, which frequency is required.
## Output Format:
### For each testcase, print   the frequency of X.
## Constraints:
## 1<=T<=100
## 1<=N<=10^6
## 1<=V[i]<=10^16
## Example:
## Input:
## 1
## 5
## 1 1 1 1 1
## 1
## Output:
